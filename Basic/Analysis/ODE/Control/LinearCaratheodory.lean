# Linear Carathéodory equations: the resolvent and the adjoint equation

For `A : ℝ → (E →L[ℝ] E)` bounded and a.e. strongly measurable on `[a, b]`, the *resolvent*
(state-transition operator) `R(s, t) = ControlSystem.resolvent A s t` is the solution at time `t`
of `Y' = A(t) ∘ Y`, `Y(s) = id`. It is the flow (`ControlSystem.flow`) of the linear control
system `Y' = B ∘ Y` on `E →L[ℝ] E` driven by the "control" `B = A(t)` with values in the compact
ball `‖B‖ ≤ K`. This file states:

* the integral equations in the final and in the initial time,
  `R(s, t) = id + ∫ₛᵗ A(r) ∘ R(s, r) dr` and `R(t, c) = id + ∫ₜᶜ R(r, c) ∘ A(r) dr`;
* the cocycle property `R(t, r) ∘ R(s, t) = R(s, r)`, hence invertibility;
* the bound `‖R(s, t)‖ ≤ e^{K|t - s|}` and Lipschitz continuity in each time;
* the *adjoint equation*: for a covector `ℓ`, `p(t) = ℓ ∘ R(t, c)` is Lipschitz and solves
  `p(t) = ℓ + ∫ₜᶜ p(r) ∘ A(r) dr`, that is `ṗ = -p ∘ A` a.e. with `p(c) = ℓ`.

## Source and reading

Agrachev–Sachkov (authors' draft) use the linear equation through the variations formula and
Proposition 11.3 (§11.5.2, p. 161: the cotangent lift of a nonautonomous flow is the flow of the
Hamiltonian lift), read pointwise along a trajectory in coordinates (departure D2 of the Layer 1
plan): the cotangent lift of the flow along `q̃` acts on covectors by `ℓ ↦ ℓ ∘ R(t, c)`, which
solves `λ̇ = -λ ∘ ∂ₓf(q̃(t), ũ(t))`.

## Proof sketch

Instance of `Basic/Analysis/ODE/Control/Caratheodory.lean` for `f(Y, B) = B ∘ Y` on `E →L[ℝ] E`
(`IsLipschitzSystem` with constant `K`, `U = closedBall 0 K`); the initial-time equation and the
adjoint equation follow from the cocycle property (`R(t, c) = R(s, c) ∘ R(t, s)`) and the final-time
equation for `R(t, s)`, or by checking that `t ↦ R(t, c) ∘ R(s, t)` is constant.
