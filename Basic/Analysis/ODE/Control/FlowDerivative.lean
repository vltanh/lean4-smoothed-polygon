# Differentiability of the flow with respect to the initial point

For a globally bounded `C¹` control system (`ControlSystem.IsBoundedC1System`) driven by a
control `u` on `[a, b]`, the flow `x ↦ P_{s → t}(x)` is differentiable, and its derivative is
the resolvent of the variational equation along the trajectory:
`D_x P_{s → t}(x) = R(s, t)` for `A(r) = ∂ₓf(P_{s → r}(x), u(r))`
(`ControlSystem.hasFDerivAt_flow`). The derivative is jointly continuous in `(s, t, x)`, and
along a trajectory the derivative from an intermediate time is the resolvent between the two
times (`ControlSystem.fderiv_flow_eq_stateTransition`).

## Source and reading

Agrachev–Sachkov (authors' draft), §2.8, formula (2.19) for the derivative of a flow (used in
the proof of Theorem 12.4 (2), p. 182: `∂F/∂q v = Φ_* P^{t₁}_* v`), and the claim of §2.4.1
that the Carathéodory solution is smooth in the initial point, cited to Gamkrelidze [8].
Read pointwise in coordinates (departure D2 of the Layer 1 plan) and with `C¹` data (D3);
proved by the standard argument (D11).

## Proof sketch

Gronwall: `P_{s → t}(x + h) - P_{s → t}(x) - R(s, t) h` solves a linear integral equation whose
inhomogeneity is `o(‖h‖)` uniformly in `t`, because `∂ₓf` is uniformly continuous on compact
subsets of `E × U` (the trajectories from `x + h` stay in a compact tube) and `P_{s → ·}(x + h)`
is `e^{L|t - s|}‖h‖`-close to `P_{s → ·}(x)`. Joint continuity of the derivative from the
continuity of the resolvent in the coefficient `A` (Gronwall again).
