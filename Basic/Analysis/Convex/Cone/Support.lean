# Supporting hyperplanes and finite generation of convex cones

Three facts about convex cones in a finite-dimensional real normed space, which the proof of the
Pontryagin maximum principle of Agrachev–Sachkov (authors' draft, §12.2) uses without comment:

* a convex cone other than the whole space has a supporting hyperplane through the origin: a
  covector `ξ ≠ 0` with `ξ ≤ 0` on the cone (`exists_dual_ne_zero_nonpos_of_ne_top`; A–S,
  proof of Theorem 12.1, p. 172: "this set has a hyperplane of support at the origin");
* if the cone hull of a set is the whole space, so is the cone hull of a finite subset
  (`exists_finset_hull_eq_top`; A–S, proof of Lemma 12.2, p. 171: "We can choose vectors …
  `i = 1, …, k`, that generate the whole tangent space as a positive convex cone"; also the step
  that gives one separating covector for all needle variations in the proof of Theorem 12.4,
  departure D9 of the Layer 1 plan);
* a finite family whose cone hull is the whole space keeps this property under small
  perturbations (`exists_forall_hull_eq_top_of_dist_lt`; A–S, p. 171: the vectors are moved to
  distinct Lebesgue points).

## Proof sketch

(1) In finite dimension a convex set whose closure is the whole space is the whole space, so a
point lies outside the closure; separate it (`geometric_hahn_banach_point_closed`) and use the
cone property. (2) Write `±eᵢ` for a basis as finite nonnegative combinations. (3) The minimum of
`max_i ξ(vᵢ)` over the unit sphere of the dual is positive (otherwise (1) applied to the hull
gives a contradiction), and it depends continuously on the `vᵢ`.
